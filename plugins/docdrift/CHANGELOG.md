# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-22

First public release.

- **Skill `spec-drift`**: set up a project (find the spec, draft and review a spec map), check
  after every change, read the results, the fast model's blind spots, reporting.
- **MCP server `docdrift`**: `check_drift`, `validate_map`, `show_payload`, `draft_map`. Finds the
  project's spec map on its own; keeps the parsed code in memory and re-reads only changed files.
- **MCP 2026-07-28**, and still serving clients of earlier revisions (dual-era): stateless
  requests with per-request `_meta`; `server/discover`; `resultType` and the server's identity on
  every result; caching hints on `tools/list` and `server/discover`; `UnsupportedProtocolVersion`
  (-32022) and invalid-request errors as specified; tool titles, annotations, and structured
  results with a declared `outputSchema`; progress notifications; cancellation stops a running
  check from sending further claims, including retries; the server shuts down promptly when the
  client closes its input, and survives malformed input. Clients that open with `initialize` (2025-11-25 and earlier) are served with the shapes
  of their revision. Roots and Logging (deprecated in 2026-07-28) are not used: the project is a
  tool argument, and the server logs only to stderr.
- **Safety**: a client-named project is a boundary (never your home folder); rate limits on
  checks (`--max-checks-per-minute`, default 20) and on all calls (`--max-calls-per-minute`,
  default 120); the MCP server takes the key only from the client's settings, the environment,
  the plugin's data folder or an absolute `--key-file`, never from the project; results go to a
  private temporary folder that is removed when the server stops.
- **Packaging**: an Agent Plugins 1.0.0 portable core (`plugin.json` with the Codex listing under
  `extensions["com.openai"]`, `mcp.json` using `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`), plus `.claude-plugin/` and
  `.mcp.json` for Claude Code (the key is asked for at install and kept in its credential store)
  and `.codex-plugin/` for Codex (forwards `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`). Dependencies are declared inline
  and installed by `uv`.
- **Languages**: Java/Spring, JavaScript/TypeScript (NestJS, Express, Hono, Fastify, Next.js),
  Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django), OpenAPI, config files; any other language by line range.
- **Spec maps**: entries can be marked `excluded` with a reason, and `--strict` counts them as
  decided; it fails on unmapped sentences, unreviewed entries, exclusions without a reason, and
  entries whose spec text has changed since they were reviewed.
- **Redaction**: secret-looking values are removed by shape everywhere and by name in code and in
  configuration files, quoted or not; see PRIVACY.md.
